		<h1>Chinas Copyright</h1>
		<h2>Legal framework</h2>

	    The whole set up of Chinas intellectual proberty in the PRC(Peoples Rebuplic of China). The PRC was built on three national laws that were passed by the National Peoples congress. Which is the trademark law, Patent Law, and the Copyright law. That really tells you something if China only has three laws to overall protect the work and companies and there citizens. The only thing that China really tries to protect is Patents, which encourages Invention-creation in the developement of science and technology.

    My conspiracy theory is that China Does'nt not really care about Patents, Trademarks, or copyright but they just want to make it seem like they do to keep there bussiness with The U.S. China's laws for copyright arnt bad but they just dont care enough.
